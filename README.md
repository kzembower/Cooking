## List of Documents:
1. Cooking Weights Equivalents.pdf
* This is a one-page chart showing the number of grams in various units (oz, tablespoons, teaspoons, each, etc) of various ingredients. Use it by locating the ingredient and the units in the first column, and following the row horizontally to the right to the column showing the number of the selected units. The number in that column is the number of grams of that number of units of that ingredient. For example, two tablespoons of coarse kosher salt is equivalent to 28.8 grams.


2. E-RCPS WEIGHT-VOLUME CONVERSION CHART FOR MANY FOODS
* This is a multi-page document giving the weight per volume conversion factors for many ingredients. It was the source information for the Cooking Weights Equivalents chart, in most cases. It can be found on the internet at https://www.e-rcps.com/pasta/links/weight_volume.shtml. Notes in the file also state that, "From the rec.food.cooking FAQ http://home.t-online.de/home/vsack/rfc_faq.html", althought that link seems to be dead. Another note says, "This chart was once posted by T. Terrell Banks who got it from a now forgotten source.  It was then preserved on William Chuang's Web site." I haven't tried to track down these sources. I also found this data here: https://stason.org/TULARC/food/cooking/2-7-5-Weight-Volume-Conversion-Chart.html

3. Cooking weight-volume conversion chart for common foods
* This is a cleaned version of the RCPS WEIGHT-VOLUME CONVERSION CHART FOR MANY FOODS data, in LiberOffice Writer format.
